        <p>Hunt: Showdown is a high-stakes, tactical PvPvE first-person shooter. Hunt for bounties in the infested Bayou, kill nightmarish monsters and outwit competing hunters - alone or in a group - with your glory, gear, and gold on the line.</p>

        <h2 class="my-5">About This Game</h2>
        <u><strong>HUNT TOGETHER. DIE ALONE.</strong></u><br> <br>The year is 1895, and you are a Hunter tasked with eliminating the savage, nightmarish monsters that have infested the Louisiana Bayou.
        Play alone or in teams of two or three, as you search for clues to help you track your target and compete against other Hunters who are after the same reward.
        Kill and banish your target, collect the bounty, and then get ready for the showdown; once the bounty is in your hands every other Hunter on the map will be after your prize.
        Show no mercy as you fight through a dark, ruthless world with brutal, period-inspired weapons, as you level up, unlock gear, and collect experience and gold for your Bloodline.
        <br><br><u><strong>HIGH-RISK, HIGH-REWARD, HIGH-TENSION GAMEPLAY</strong></u><br><br>
        Competitive, match-based gameplay combines PvP and PvE elements to create a uniquely tense PvEvP experience where your character and your gear are always on the line.
        Succeed, and you will be rewarded handsomely but remember – a single mistake could cost you your Hunter – and any gear they were carrying.
