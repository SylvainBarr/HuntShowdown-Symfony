A spider the size of a quarter, though, is manageable. But, at the size of a horse, even the most rational and logical would recoil in disgust at an eight-legged arachnid, gnashing its mandibles, expelling coils of webbing.The Spider strikes the ardent occultist as one of the most outlandish and monstrous examples of the hysteria that so gripped the bayous.

Before its arrival, the entity\'s major aspects were certainly formidable combatants, though designed for other purposes. The humanoid Assassin seemed especially sculpted to shock humans, and destroy them.<br>Accounts of such a creature are similar: that of a tall humanoid figure who can seemingly melt into a swarm of insects.

(5, 1, 'Scrapbeak', 'scrapbeak', '<i>Researcher\'s Notes</i><br> <i>Handwritten</i><br> <i>Undated</i><br><br>\nThe question of the beak is paramount. Initially, I had supposed it a mask, fashioned from the scavenged detritus the creature holds so dear, a theory supported by the fact that the beak\'s composition does not resemble that of any bird yet catalogued by man. However, dissection reveals that the periphery of the beak-structure is fused with the bone of the skull, though the mandibles and the surrounding musculature are curiously positioned, non-functional, and show extensive scarring. The scar tissue is singular, exhibiting attributes of both keloid and hypertrophic tissue, and marked in such a way as to suggest a violently expediated healing process.\n<br><br>\nFrom this, I must conclude that the beak was not part of the beast\'s original physiognomy, but rather a more recent addition — an addition that could only have been made through a most gruesome surgical procedure — and that the healing process was accelerated and warped by the transformation process of which I still, maddeningly, know so little. I shudder to think of it, for I can imagine no circumstance under which a man might agree, of his own free will, to allow such a surgery to take place, or the physician willing to perform it. Finding that physician - possibly under the influence of the corruption themselves - would give the most valuable insight into this creature. Perhaps the Sculptor is not, in the end, the most egregious being in the Bayou. One must only read the headlines of the daily papers to know the staggering capacity for cruelty of the human specimen. \n<br><br>\n', 'https://i.redd.it/ct5hh03bekr61.png'),
(6, 2, 'Grunt', 'grunt', '<p><br>\r\nIt is quite difficult to perform any typological analysis of this Louisiana incident. I\'m starting to think these events may have been the beginning of the zombie stories we have today. It certainly matches the pattern: Some kind of deadly infection hits a settlement, almost wipes out the whole population, and then the dead rise from their graves in order to feast on the living. Though this is the only zombie story I\'ve heard where the zombies take up weapons - torches and blades in most cases - to wield against the living. The old adage holds: truth is always far stranger than fiction.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\nIt seems like the hunters of this era were simply calling them Grunts. There are conflicting reports of course, but the material I have found so far appears to be talking about what\'s probably a slow-moving and mostly human creature, possibly the victim of a viral infection, or controlled by some kind of greater spirit or Loa.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\nWhile at times I seem to be grasping at straws to identify some of the more specialized monsters in the source texts, Grunts are ubiquitous, to say the least. Of particular value, an autopsy performed and recovered almost in full from the journal of Dr. Reinhard Winkler that I\'ve included in the archive.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\nAccording to reports, you could quickly dispatch a Grunt quickly with a well-placed head shot. I still wouldn\'t want to meet one in the dark. And certainly not in numbers.\r\n</p>', 'https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c2/c4/2a/c2c42a838d7f7ce4484c5461fa327606.jpg'),
(7, 3, 'Armored', 'armored', '<i>Researcher\'s insight into the Armored</i>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Undated</i>\r\n<br><br>\r\nI\'ve used the works of Scognamiglio himself to illustrate the comprehensive analysis of the Armored, a rare pleasure as so few survived. A more physical analysis is available from Harold Black. It follows:\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Armored, its name has proved remarkably ambiguous. Some invoke a defensive figure, one that is willing to slip back into its shell. That could not be further from the apparent truth, as many accounts suggest the opposite. A creature well protected, enabled to go on dangerous offensives. A shock troop; with more mobility, and so flexibility, than the gigantic Meathead.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTo paraphrase George Washington, \"offensive operations are the surest means of defense.\" So, this specimen is seemingly equipped to relentless pursuit of its targets, protected from their retaliatory fire. One account cites it intelligent enough to smash through doors, though this cannot be verified.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSo, what is its armor protecting? A fool would think itself. No. Again and again, these enemies are encountered in proximity to Rifts, those apparently vulnerable or important locations to the beast. They lurk behind doors, linger on doorstops: all potential chokepoints, all vital locations to control.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe hunters\' name for it was pragmatic; they did not dabble into occultism to explain it. While it\'s as certain this creature existed, as certain as the Grunts at least, its taxonomy is indeterminate. \r\nSome think of it as little more than an Armored Grunt, some mutation having thickened the skin and developed a chitinous exoskeleton. I would differ on this point, it\'s frequently noted that the Armored\'s husk is particularly flammable, and was vulnerable to all manner of incendiary devices.\r\n<br><br>\r\nOthers, who perhaps align more closely with my own beliefs, think of it as something distinct in its own right. That such a mutation must have a more significant purpose.\r\n<br><br>\r\n', 'https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/010/015/980/large/artem-shumnik-armored-01.jpg?1522101672'),

Though she appears to have been classified alongside the other Grunts, she was a far more dangerous creature, setting a swarm of insects upon any human in range until their bodies were punctured and swollen and heaving with their vile poison. Only her own death - the death of their host, the Hive Mother - stopped their persistent attacks. Though she could be safely killed from afar with a shot to the head, the positioning of her body made the task difficult even for the best marksmen. Blunt damage could harm her, though little else, and in the time it might have taken to try, her beastly swarms would have already stung their prey into flight or submission.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLooking at the bigger picture, I am attempting to understand the purpose each form served in the eye of their creator. The documents I have collected - in particular the interviews with Ada Shell - have led me to hypothesize that the Hive\'s function was both to host and to disseminate the malady. Convert or kill at a distance; perpetuate the \"race.\" I am reminded of the writings of Trask, active at that time, who was convinced that a woman\'s divine mission was the \"perpetuation of the race\" through continuous breeding. The seed of this idea - twisted though it became - was personified in the first Hive on record, as you will see.\r\n<br><br>\r\n', 'https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/014/735/882/large/florian-reschenhofer-hive-02-mood.jpg?1545232263'),

The smallest movement sends him into a rage, attacking chaotically, and when shot he burns even hotter and charges like an angry bull. He is, of course, extinguished in water (and can be fatally consumed by his own internal flames), but otherwise, represents the most intelligent example I have seen. The beast can actually open doors!\r\n<br><br>\r\nI have noticed certain Biblical parallels in the story that - I believe -describes the very first occurrence. Did the religious factions have it right after all? I wonder. We both assumed that the folklore was just that: lore, scary bedtime stories. Another author\'s futile attempt to force linear, comprehensible human meaning onto an inexplicable event. What if this time, they got it right?\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe beatings that led to Jeremy\'s transformation must have taken place in a volatile location, but it is unlikely that any of the perpetrators were aware of that. One witness survived and is listed as having been admitted to the asylum, diagnosed with religious mania, and terrified of hellfires.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI found both Clemens\' journal and part of the serial referenced and added both to the archives: it\'s quite a violent tale.\r\n<br><br>\r\n', 'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TJq7RvVwPMxNhUgDtnM4ZD.jpg'),

The creature has no head. It could best be described as a bloated, headless, humanoid monster. More easily cut than shot; a hard hitter, but too well insulated to take much damage from a fist or a blunt object. It appears to have a symbiotic relationship with leeches, though these, too, are not the creatures you might recognize as such. The leeches appear to have acted as the creature\'s sensory organs, allowing him to see, to find prey, and to weaken that prey with their own poisonous bites. They are a clever extension of the creature, advance troops in a way.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Scognamiglio, that fool. He called them Soul Farmers, but I can\'t see why. He thought they were vampiric essentially, feeding on souls rather than blood. He imagined them walking into towns in the night, harvesting the \"souls\" of the people. But read just one first-hand description of this creature, and you will understand that it could not just walki into a town to quietly harvest the souls of its inhabitants. It had no eyes, no mouth to feed with, and it barely fit through most doors. It is not a subtle creature. Not in any way, leaving trail of leeches in its wake.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>However, I believe I have found documents that Scognamiglio missed, in his single-minded focus on the occult, and I have unearthed a letter from our own . Huff among the papers of William Salter, almost lost for the carelessness of my colleague!, that may illuminate its origins.\r\n</p>', 'https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1300859615169503233/Y9J1M8Ub_400x400.jpg'),

These hounds would work together to take down a target, and while they do not appear to have any kind of special defenses, they did not have any particular vulnerabilities either.\r\n<br><br>\r\nNow, I know I have said in the past that I find certain aspects of this case unbelivable. And yet, you must know that i do believe. If I did not, I would not be keeping this journal. But the Hellhound, omnipreset in myth and legend to the point of banality, strikes me as the one creature among them that is more likely a story than a reality. People have always feared dogs, even as they began to domesticate them and live side by side. Were these specimens really supernatural creatures, as reported? Or just highly aggressive, feral dogs, made all the nastier when the plague made food - and human kindness - scarce?\r\n<br><br>\r\nScognamiglio believed they were Italian mastiffs, possessed by the corruption. Othersources describe them as \"undead dogs,\" but we must consider their reliability. Braggarts exaggerate. Reports of viciously collared and muzzled hounds indicate that there was in fact an infection, but whether it was of supernatural (corruption) or scientific (rabies) origins, I cannot say, as the sources on this point, to my mind, are inconclusive at best.\r\n<br><br>\r\n', 'https://cdn-apolk.nitrocdn.com/OQiePNRUqJfHBqLKvZoiGpdqxWyrBWmu/assets/images/optimized/rev-6735be3/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Hellhound-painting-1024x525.jpg'),
(12, 4, 'Water Devil', 'water-devil', 'My initial suspicions about the origins of the Water Devil have been refuted absolutely by my latest research. I had thought the thing was related to some species of eel. Even a Gar or a Bowfish would have seemed logical. Or so I thought. But I\'m getting ahead of myself. Let me begin with the creature itself, as the hunters knew it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThough it would be easy to mistake it for one many-tentacled creature, the Water Devil is in fact a swarm of smaller aquatic animals. It seemed to sense the presence of anything entering its home waters, and its movements were quick and decisive. Because of its swarm-like nature, it was hard to kill with bullets or any sort of melee attack, and often the best recourse was simply to run for the shore.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFor a long time, the waters of the bayou appeared to have gone silent. The usual wildlife had either fled, or been killed. Or both: it is likely that the creatures devoured whatever wildlife was not quick enough to flee to safer waters, but several populations of alligators clearly survived the infestation. \r\nCollins and Scognamiglio seem to agree on this point, as well as on the creatures\' appearance, though at the moment, I find all of it a bit fantastic. No wonder, as our main surviving source on the subject of its appearance is a fictionalized version of the tale.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThough the logic (well, the assumed logic) of these creatures\' form and function may be twisted and strange, the Water Devil feels outside of that framework, like an experiment gone wrong. I cannot pinpoint its purpose for the larger organism, and I imagine that, for example, a monstrous, ravenous alligator, able to move both in water and on land, would have served its purpose more immediately.\r\n<br><br>\r\n', 'https://www.huntshowdown.com/files/wysiwyg/59c4a3aafb3b8dcd81209b4da6e97b2a.jpg');
